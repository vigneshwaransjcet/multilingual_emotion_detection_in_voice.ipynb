# Multilingual Emotion Detection in Voice

This project focuses on detecting emotions from voice data across multiple languages using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a robust model that can recognize emotions such as happiness, anger, sadness, and more from speech samples in different languages.

## 🚀 Features

- Multilingual support for emotion detection.
- Preprocessing of audio data including feature extraction.
- Classification using machine learning models.
- Visualization of model performance.

## 🧠 Model Overview

The notebook uses audio feature extraction techniques (e.g., MFCCs) and machine learning classifiers (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) to predict emotions from voice data.
